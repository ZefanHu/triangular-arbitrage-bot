# main.py Implementation Summary

## Overview
The `main.py` file has been successfully implemented as the main entry point for the OKX Triangular Arbitrage Trading Bot.

**Latest Update**: Enhanced monitoring interface with comprehensive market analysis display and real-time price monitoring.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. TradingBot Class
- **Environment Check**: Validates API configuration, trading config, and log directory
- **Mode Selection**: Supports two modes:
  - Auto Mode: Fully automated trading
  - Monitor Mode: Only monitors opportunities without trading

### 2. System Initialization
- Creates and configures TradingController with Rich logging enabled
- Handles mode-specific configurations (e.g., disabling trading in monitor mode)

### 3. Enhanced Real-time Monitoring Interface
- Uses Rich library for beautiful terminal UI with color coding
- Layout with 5 main sections:
  - Header: System status, time, mode, and risk level
  - Left panel: ALL arbitrage analyses (profitable & unprofitable) with profit rates
  - Middle panel: Real-time prices for key trading pairs
  - Right panel: Trading statistics, risk management, and account balances
  - Footer: System metrics and analysis rate
- Features:
  - Displays all market analyses, not just profitable opportunities
  - Color-coded profit rates (green/yellow/red)
  - Real-time bid/ask prices and spreads
  - Dynamic visual feedback based on performance

### 4. Graceful Shutdown
- Signal handling for SIGINT and SIGTERM
- Ensures trading controller stops safely
- Displays final statistics report

### 5. Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks for all critical operations
- Logging of errors to file
- User-friendly error messages in console

## Usage

```bash
# Run the trading bot
python3 main.py

# Or if made executable
./main.py
```

## Integration with Existing Modules
- Uses `TradingController` as the main control center
- Leverages `ConfigManager` for configuration
- Integrates with logging system via `setup_logger`
- Follows the pattern from `examples/real_time_monitor.py`

## Notes
- The implementation is production-ready
- Supports asyncio for concurrent operations
- Provides clear user feedback at each step
- Handles exceptions gracefully with proper cleanup
